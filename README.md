# react_app
For each event, you will present the badge, the Add Enrollment button, the Delete event button but you will also present the name of the event and at the top, you will present a heading and the TOTAL OF ENROLLMENTS (which is a sum of all the counters of the events/courses listed).
There will be 4 events/courses – see the id of each event between parentheses – each event will also have a counter that will start with 0 (zero) that will represent the number of enrollments:
• React JS vs Angular (id = 1)
• ASP.NET Core or Node JS? (id = 2)
• Lifecycle of React JS Components (id =3)
• Comparing JavaScript Libraries/Frameworks (id =4)
